# WIA1006 Machine Learning Course

Welcome to my WIA1006 Machine Learning course repository during my Year 1 Semester 2 in University of Malaya! This repository contains two lab works for the Machine Learning course during my time. ðŸ™Œ 

## The Labworks are done using Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda.
- Download it here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

## Steps to use Anaconda to open Jupyter Notebook:
1. Open Anaconda Prompt
2. Type in "Jupyter Notebook"
3. Open up Jupyter Notebook, create your files/workspaces, and start on your project ðŸ’ª

## Labwork 1: Prediction of House Pricing using Linear Regression
In this Labwork 1, I have use Linear Regression to predict house prices based on features such as area, price number of bedrooms etc. I explored and visualized the dataset, handle missing data & outliers, and preprocess it. Then, I built a Linear Regression model, train it on the data, and evaluate its performance. 

## Labwork 2: Wine Classification using Neural Networks
In this Labwork 2, I habe to classify wines into red or white wines using Neural Networks. I had to design 5 Neural Network model together with the best hyperparameters and find the best model with the highest accuracy and after evaluate its performance in the end.

## Usage
To use the materials in this repository, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the lab work directory you wish to explore. Then, launch Jupyter Notebook and open the Jupyter Notebook file for the lab work (follow steps above).
