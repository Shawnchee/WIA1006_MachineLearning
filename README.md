# WIA1006 Machine Learning Course

Welcome to my WIA1006 Machine Learning course repository during my Year 1 Semester 2 in University of Malaya! This repository contains two lab works for the Machine Learning course during my time. ðŸ™Œ 

## The Labworks are done using Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda.
- Download it here: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

## Steps to use Anaconda to open Jupyter Notebook:
1. Open Anaconda Prompt
2. Type in "Jupyter Notebook"
3. Open up Jupyter Notebook, create your files/workspaces, and start on your project ðŸ’ª

## Labwork 1: Prediction of House Pricing using Linear Regression
## Labwork 2: Wine Classification using Neural Networks

## Usage
To use the materials in this repository, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the lab work directory you wish to explore. Then, launch Jupyter Notebook and open the Jupyter Notebook file for the lab work (follow steps above).
